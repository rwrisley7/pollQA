PollQA (pronounced "polka") is a simple polling site built in PHP 5.5 with Phalcon.

To run it, Phalcon will need to be installed on your server: https://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/install.html

Questions.sql contains the required mysql database populated with a few users, some questions, and answers.
The demo users and passwords are:
username | password | details
-----------------------------
quizzer  | password | asked all the questions
knower   | password | answered all the questions
demo     | demo     | answered some questions

app/config/config.ini will need to be updated with your database settings
